## Roadmap

1. Get WASD/arrow keys camera working. - Done
2. Insert a large floor
3. Make a "run" button
4. Insert a flag, that when touched, disappears and text that says "You win"
5. Insert a cylinder. Put flag on top. Make it so big you can't see the flag anymore
   without mouse look.
6. Get mouse look working.
7. Put stairs on the cylinder going up, get gravity/floor working.
8. Put moat that must me jumped between tower and initial hero location.
   Moat needs a ramp that goes back up so that player can try again without being
   too frustrating.
9. Put in mouth ids. They grow like tadpoles, with just initial tail (for moving), hind legs (for jumping),
   fore arms (for throwing)
10. Make a trident spear for killing them.
11. insert Giants.
